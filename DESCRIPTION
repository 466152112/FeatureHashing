Description: Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick, is a method to 
  transform features to vector. Without looking the indices up in an 
  associative array, it applies a hash function to the features and uses their 
  hash values as indices directly. 
    The FeatureHashing package implements the method which was introduced in 
  Weinberger et. al. (2009). The package also provides an interface similar 
  to `model.matrix` in R and `Matrix::sparse.model.matrix` in the Matrix 
  package. Splitting of concatenated feature, please see the help of `test.tag` 
  for details, is also supported.
