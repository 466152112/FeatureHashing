Description: Feature hashing is a method to transform features to vector. Without looking
  the indices up in an associative array, it applies a hash function to the features and
  uses their hash values as indices directly. 
  The FeatureHashing package implements the hashing trick introduced in Weinberger et. 
  al. (2009) and provides an interface similar to `model.matrix` in R and 
  `Matrix::sparse.model.matrix` in the Matrix package. Splitting of concatenated data, please
  see the help of `test.tag` for example, is also supported.
