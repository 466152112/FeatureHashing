Description: Feature hashing, also known as hashing trick, 
  is a fast and space-efficient way to vectorize features.
  It also synchronizes model matrix from different data set.
  FeatureHashing hashes the model matrix to save the space
  and enhance the efficiency of fitting algorithms. The 
  improvement should be significant for model matrix with
  lots of categorical features.
