Description: Feature hashing is a popular trick to vectorize text features. 
  The pakcage FeatureHashing implements the hashing trick introduced in 
  Weinberger et. al. (2009) 
  and provides an API similar to model.matrix and Matrix::sparse.model.matrix 
  in R. 
  The FeatureHashing also supports the splitting of concatenated data during 
  the constructiong of model matrix to save the memory.
