Description: Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick, is a method to 
  transform features to vector. Without looking up the indices in an 
  associative array, it applies a hash function to the features and uses their 
  hash values as indices directly. 
  The method of feature hashing proposed in Weinberger et al. (2009) is implemented with Murmurhash3
  with a formula interface in R. See the README.md for more information.
