Description: Feature hashing is a popular trick to enhance the efficiency of 
  feature extraction in the field of text mining. The pakcage FeatureHashing integrate
  the hashing trick proposed by Weinberger et. al. (2009) into the construction of 
  model matrix in R. The FeatureHashing also supports the splitting of concatenated 
  data during the constructiong of model matrix.
